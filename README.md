# Hi! I'm Quinn! 💬

A bit about me: I'm a Taiwanese nerd studying **journalism ✍️ & data science 🧑‍💻** at NYU, which is why I code silly things like Blackjack games and D&D point buy systems. In the near future, I'm hoping to learn how to integrate data analysis, visualization, and journalism all into a cohesive piece, and tell some pretty cool stories that way!

Fun fact: I forgot I made a GitHub profile with the username "quinnathy" earlier this year, angrily made another GitHub named "quinnathyy," and then finally realized my folly. To any future Quinn's with this specific nickname who plan on getting on GitHub in the future... I'm sorry.
