# Hi! I'm Quinn! üí¨

A bit about me: I'm a Taiwanese nerd studying **journalism ‚úçÔ∏è & data science üßë‚Äçüíª** at NYU, which is why I code silly things like Blackjack games and D&D point buy systems. In the near future, I'm hoping to learn how to integrate data analysis, visualization, and journalism all into a cohesive piece, and tell some pretty cool stories that way!

For now, I work mostly in Python and front-end dev (for example, I built [my own website](https://qsental.com) from scratch, and I'm pleased to announce that at least three Professional Journalists have given it a glowing review). But I'm planning on learning D3 and Node.js as well very soon, so if you have any tips for those, please do send them to me.

You can find me on my aforementioned website, on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinnsental/), or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/darkerintheday)! I refuse on principle to call it "X," so infer about me what you will from that.

Fun fact: I forgot I made a GitHub profile with the username "quinnathy" earlier this year, angrily made another GitHub named "quinnathyy," and then finally realized my folly. To any future Quinn's with this specific nickname who plan on getting on GitHub in the future... I'm sorry.
